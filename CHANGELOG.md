What to expect in future?
As docFiller moves more towards stability, we want to focus more on improving UI/UX and prompts as well. One of the requested features, we acknowledge was to not fill the forms that has been manually/automatically filled earlier, to save costs and time, but it might take some time to see it in docFiller yet as it requires some arch changes.
